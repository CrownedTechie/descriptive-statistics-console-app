# Console App for Descriptive Statistics

## Introduction
This is one of Learnable's week 4 task to demonstrate my understanding on the use of ES6 Javascript Classes and objects. In additon to this, I also made use of the spread and rest operators. Concerning this app, It allows users to calculate descriptive statistics - Measures of Central Tendency and Measures of Dispersion respectively for ungrouped data only. 

## Features
+ It has just one class - DescriptiveStatistics class.
+ For Measures of Central Tendency, user is able to calculate for the mean, median and mode of the data.
+ For Measures of Dispersion, user is able to calculate for the range, variance, standard deviation, mean deviation, and quartile deviation.
